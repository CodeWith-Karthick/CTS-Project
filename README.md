Patient Sentiment &amp; Adverse Effect Analysis
Patient Sentiment & Adverse Effect Analysis is an AI-driven system that analyzes patient feedback to extract valuable insights regarding their experiences with medical treatments, medications, and healthcare services. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), this system identifies sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and detects potential adverse effects from patient reviews, social media discussions, and medical records.

The analysis helps healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and policymakers improve patient care, enhance drug safety, and address concerns proactively. It also aids in early detection of adverse drug reactions, ensuring better medical outcomes and patient satisfaction.
